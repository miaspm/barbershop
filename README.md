## Welcome to my learning project - a website for "Borodinski barbershop"

in this project I have implemented the knowledge **semantic html5**. And I have also made a shopping cart and a slider using **css3**.

On this site you can make *an appointment*, and there is also a page of an *online shop* where you can buy items for hair care. On this page you will see two usefull *filters* for "brands" and "product categories" and also a *toggle* to adjust the price range.

This project is under development, as I learn javascript I will gladly add more and more features to the site. 

Thank you for your interest in my project!
